# Stand-ups for agile teams, notes taken by Yiju

## What's Stand-up meeting?

Stand-ups mainly server for two purposes: the first is to make the team together, "Like a sports team's huddle" and the second is to make the team works like a team by eliminating the infomation gaps.

## General Structure of stand-ups
The stand-ups are contructed by three questions(Not always these three questions, but these three questions give us an idea on how stand-ups work):
- What did I do yesterday?(Summary)
- What's my plan for today?(Plan)
- What are the difficulties(Asking for help)

## Some important features of stand-ups
To make an effecient and actually useful stand-up, there are couple of things we need to be careful about:
- Make it as a routine, either daily, twice a week, the frequency does not matter, but it should be a routine rather than something happenes mysteriously.
- Make it equals to everyone. This means that the meeting time should be at the same convinience level for all the members, and all members should either meet in-person or remote. And everyone should attend the meeting.
- Agile style: Need feedback to modify the stand-up structure so it could become more efficient.
